**Basic knowledge scraping with CSS selectors**

CSS selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to thus allowing to extract data from matching tags and attributes.

If you haven't scraped with CSS selectors, there's a dedicated blog post of mine about [how to use CSS selectors when web-scraping](https://serpapi.com/blog/web-scraping-with-css-selectors-using-python/) that covers what it is, pros and cons, and why they're matter from a web-scraping perspective and show the most common approaches of using CSS selectors when web scraping.


**Separate virtual environment**

In short, it's a thing that creates an independent set of installed libraries including different Python versions that can coexist with each other at the same system thus prevention libraries or Python version conflicts.

If you didn't work with a virtual environment before, have a look at the dedicated [Python virtual environments tutorial using Virtualenv and Poetry](https://serpapi.com/blog/python-virtual-environments-using-virtualenv-and-poetry/) blog post of mine to get familiar.

üìåNote: this is not a strict requirement for this blog post.

**Install libraries**:

```lang-none
pip install requests lxml beautifulsoup4
```

**Reduce the chance of being blocked**

There's a chance that a request might be blocked. Have a look at [how to reduce the chance of being blocked while web-scraping](https://serpapi.com/blog/how-to-reduce-chance-of-being-blocked-while-web/), there are eleven methods to bypass blocks from most websites.
