**Basic knowledge scraping with CSS selectors**

CSS selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to thus allowing to extract data from matching tags and attributes.

If you haven't scraped with CSS selectors, there's a dedicated blog post of mine
about [how to use CSS selectors when web-scraping](https://serpapi.com/blog/web-scraping-with-css-selectors-using-python/) that covers what it is, pros and cons, and why they matter from a web-scraping perspective.

**Separate virtual environment**

In short, it's a thing that creates an independent set of installed libraries including different Python versions that can coexist with each other in the same system thus preventing libraries or Python version conflicts.

If you didn't work with a virtual environment before, have a look at the
dedicated [Python virtual environments tutorial using Virtualenv and Poetry](https://serpapi.com/blog/python-virtual-environments-using-virtualenv-and-poetry/) blog post of mine to get a little bit more familiar.


üìåNote: this is not a strict requirement for this blog post.

**Install libraries**:

```lang-none
pip install requests parsel
```

**Reduce the chance of being blocked**

There's a chance that a request might be blocked. Have a look
at [how to reduce the chance of being blocked while web-scraping](https://serpapi.com/blog/how-to-reduce-chance-of-being-blocked-while-web/), there are eleven methods to bypass blocks from most websites.
