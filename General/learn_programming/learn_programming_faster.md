## Intro

This blog post is purely subjective and was created solely from personal experience when faced with certain obstacles in the course of learning programming. The examples in the illustrations can probably apply to many people, that's why I decided to write this post.

## Beginner developer problem

## What is comfort zone? Should I be in there?

### The comfort zone is good. 

For me, the comfort zone is when I feel secure and not overwhelmed by many things. This does not mean sitting in one place for a long time without a change of scenery or something else, although I don’t see anything wrong with that. For some, it fits, and for some, it doesn't.

### Comfort zone from the programming perspective

From the programming perspective, it brings things such as the ability to focus on specific things instead of everything at once, which could lead to torning between things. It lets gain experience (skill) faster by only studying specific things which in turn brings faster iterations between trials and errors. 

### Comfort zone applicable to everything

All of this stuff is applicable not only for programming. 

If you want to start playing piano you need to focus on that and study specifc things i.e notes, chords, sight reading, key signature and intervals (2nds, 3rds, 5ths...), and practicing it regularly until you feel that you can move to a different thing i.e from notes to chords.

## Get the best out of learning without feeling overwhelmed

### Focus on a specific thing 

As you understand, to learn something faster, you need to focus on specific things. It requires nothing more than focus, time, and constant practice. You already knew about it but might forget. 

### Start an email/telegram newsletter

Another thing might be handy to start writing your email/telegram newsletter or something similar that can be done on a daily, weekly or monthly basis where you can teach yourself by teaching others.

### Organize your thoughts

For example, you want to figure out whether you like data analysis or not. How to go about it? 

|Phase|Example|
|-----|-------|
|**Focus-1**|Figure out data analysis.|
|**Study**|Learn Python fundamentals either by yourself or with some course.|
|**Experience**|Gained experience in Python, started trying data analysis libraries such as `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Seaborn` for a _specific_ task.|
|**Repeat**|Get additional knowledge about data analysis by creating a specific project which can be simplified.|
|**Speed Boost**|Now you know how to use some functions in combo to get rampage code because you gained some experience searching them.|
|**Focus-2**|Figure out how to create an animated historical time-series chart movement of Uber taxi drivers in New York.|

### Next time is going to be much easier

The most interesting thing about all of this is that the experience gained during the study will be transferred to the next skill that you want to learn. It will be clearer how to go through the learning material, where and how to take examples for study, etc.
