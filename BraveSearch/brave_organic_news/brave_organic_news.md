<h3 id="brave">What is Brave Search</h3>

For the sake of non-duplicating content, I already wrote about [what is Brave search](https://serpapi.com/blog/scrape-brave-search-organic-results-with-python/) in the previous Brave blog post.

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

This blog post is a continuation of the Brave Search web scraping series. Here you'll see how to scrape Organic News Results from Brave Search using Python with `beautifulsoup`, `requests`, `lxml` libraries.

> Note: HTML layout might be changed in the future thus some of `CSS` selectors might not work. <a href="#outro"> Let me know</a> if something isn't working.

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

```python
pip install requests
pip install lxml 
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

Make sure you have a basic knowledge of the libraries mentioned above, since this blog post is *not exactly a tutorial for beginners*, so **be sure** you have a basic familiarity with them.  I'll try my best to show in code that it's not that difficult.

Also, make sure you have a basic understanding of  `CSS` selectors because of  `select()`/`select_one()` `beautifulsoup` methods that accepts `CSS` selectors.  [`CSS` selectors reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp).

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
Continuing Dune adventure let's scrape news about Dune movie from the Brave search.

As usually, we need to find a container with needed data first, in order to iterate over each element afterwards:

![container with needed data](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/n6ov8s9fpg0hppnmnff3.png)

Screenshot translates to this:

```python
for news_result in soup.select('#news-carousel .card'):
    # further code..
```

After picking a container, we need to grab other elements, such as title, link, displayed link, source website, and a thumbnail with appropriate `CSS` selectors:

<img width="100%" style="width:100%" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/BJcohDYT4QWorWrYG5/giphy.gif">
