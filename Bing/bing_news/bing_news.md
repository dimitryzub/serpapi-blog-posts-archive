### Intro
Well, hello there to people who came from the last Bing series! This blog post is a continuation of Bing's web scraping series and contains info about how to scrape Bing News results using Python. An alternative solution will be shown after the first block of code.

### Imports
```python
import requests
import lxml
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from serpapi import GoogleSearch
```

### What will be scraped

### Process
The process is straight-forward. [SelectorGadget](https://selectorgadget.com/) Chrome extension was to grab `CSS` selectors.

The following GIF illustrates how to get `CSS` selectors of the **Title**, **URL**, **Snippet**, **Source website**, and when news has been posted.

### Code
```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests, lxml

headers = {
    "User-Agent":
    "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/70.0.3538.102 Safari/537.36 Edge/18.19582"
}

html = requests.get('https://www.bing.com/news/search?q=faze+clan', headers=headers)
soup = BeautifulSoup(html.text, 'lxml')

for result in soup.select('.card-with-cluster'):
    title = result.select_one('.title').text
    link = result.select_one('.title')['href']
    snippet = result.select_one('.snippet').text
    source = result.select_one('.source a').text
    date_posted = result.select_one('#algocore span+ span').text
    print(f'{title}\n{link}\n{source}\n{date_posted}\n{snippet}\n')
